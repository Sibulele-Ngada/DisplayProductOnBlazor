## What I learned

- The entire tech stack is new to me. I've learned a new language along with the frameworks that it's used with.
- I learned how to build in .NET environment
- I learned how to implement repository pattern, (working on mediator pattern next)

  ## What was hardest

  - Definitely figuring out the library. Whilst I'm new to c# it isn't much different from Java, ruunning SQL queries I found went smoothly, but knowing what I wanted to do and figuring out how/where to do it took most of my time
